CrimeCity
=========

Crime City is an Operation Flashpoint / Arma private game-mode with too much to do. 

I'm porting this to Arma 3 once the Java API is released, and for now I'm re-coding it from the ground up for Garry's Mod. 

Features included ( And I hope to bring most, if not all of these to Garry's Mod from OFP/Arma and then to Arma 3 )

Smuggling, Driving, Vehicle Tuning, Drivers Licenses, AI Police, AI Inmates, Territories, Reciprocity between terrotories, Prison Transport, Piloting, Pilots Licenses, Insurance, Education system, Work System, Experience System, AI Public Transportation System, Treasure Hunting ( Think DayZ loot spawns years before DayZ existed ), Pawn Shops ( to bring the loot to ), Weapon Licensing, Government jobs, Ruling a town or an entire territory, Terrorists, Neutral, Good, Vehicle Turbos, Boating, Boating Licenses, Job Ranks, Job Positions, Working Women, Mass Event System ( Terrorism, Natural Disasters, Riots, Races ), Full Environmental Effects System, Drivers Test System ( Written and driven ), Pilots Test System ( Written and Flown ), Boating Test System ( Written and Operation ), Military, Own a business, Build a home, and much much more!
